        <p>Welcome to Meals Around the World!!
            Our company was initially founded with the aim of exposing Kenyans to different types of cuisines from around the world. But as we have grown, we have come to realise that not only Kenyans use out website but other people around the world too.
            <br>We are very honored about that and we hope you will discover the joy of preparing meals in a different way than you're used to and just how much variation there is to what you're used to.</br>
            <br><em>Whip out your utensils and let this amazing journey begin!</em></b>
