**Setup Requirements**
This repository focuses on Flatdango, an app where you can buy movie tickets for movies showing at Flatiron Movie Theater! I used a local API to build out the frontend for the app.
The list of the movies currently showing is displayed in the homepage.
When a user clicks on a movies’s name, they're able to see its details that is the movie poster, time of showing, the runtime of the movie and the number of tickets available for purchase. This prevents a customer from purchasing a ticket when they're sold out.
